# odin-recipes
This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum and focuses on building a basic recipe website to practice foundational HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have:

    Gained hands-on experience with structuring HTML documents using semantic elements.
    Practiced creating and linking multiple web pages to build a functional website.
    Used unordered and ordered lists to display content logically.
    Worked with images and hyperlinks to enhance web page content.
    Established a project workflow using Git for version control and GitHub for project sharing.

This project lays the groundwork for further web development learning, including styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript in the future.
